# binarycircles
A program to draw binary circles in a square grid. If the first bit of a binary number is a 1 then a large black circle is drawn. If it is a 0, no circle is drawn. Then the second bit is checked, if that is a 1, a bit smaller circle is drawn atc till the center of a circle. For every number (eg 2Ë†bits numbers) a circle is drawn.

The result is exported to a SVG-file. This file can be opened in InkScape, cleaned (the SVG exporter always put a square around the result. You want to get rid of that one),put in the right document size (A4 or Letter), and plotted using an AxiDraw (by https://www.evilmadscientist.com). 

You have to use very fine pencil to see the seperate circles above 8 bits.
