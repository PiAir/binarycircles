#binarycircles
A program to draw binary circles in a square grid. 
If the first bit of a binary number is a 1 then a large black circle is drawn. 
If it is a 0, no circle is drawn. Then the second bit is checked, if that is a 1,
a bit smaller circle is drawn and so on till the center of a circle. For every number 
(eg 2Ë†its numbers) a circle is drawn.

The result is exported to a SVG-file. This file can be opened in InkScape, cleaned
(the SVG exporter always put a square around the result; you want to get rid of that one),
put in the right document size (A4 or Letter), and plotted using an AxiDraw 
(by https://www.evilmadscientist.com). 

You have to use very fine pencils to see the seperate circles if you want to use more than 8 bits.
